- Certainly, let's break down messages, queues, and events in simple terms, along with a real-life example:

**Messages:**
Messages are like little packets of information that one part of a computer system can send to another part. These messages can contain all sorts of important details or instructions. Imagine sending a note to a friend with a question â€“ that note is like a message in a computer system.

**Queue:**
A queue is like a waiting line for messages. When a computer system has a lot of messages to send or tasks to do, it lines them up in a queue. Just like people waiting in line for their turn at a ticket counter, messages wait in a queue until they're ready to be processed.

**Events:**
Events are like signals that tell different parts of a computer system that something has happened. They're like notifications that say, "Hey, this just occurred!" These notifications help parts of the system know when to do something specific.

**Real-Life Example: Online Food Delivery Service**

Let's say you're running an online food delivery service, like a modern-day pizza delivery app. Here's how messages, queues, and events might come into play:

1. **Messages:**
   You want to tell the kitchen what pizza someone has ordered and where it needs to be delivered. You send a message containing the order details like the type of pizza, delivery address, and contact number. This message ensures the kitchen knows exactly what to prepare.

2. **Queue:**
   Now imagine many people are ordering pizzas all at once. Instead of overwhelming the kitchen with all the orders at once, the orders are placed in a queue. It's like a line of orders. The kitchen takes one order at a time from the front of the line and prepares that pizza. Then, it moves on to the next order in the queue.

3. **Events:**
   When the pizza is ready, an event is generated. This event tells the delivery driver that the pizza is hot and ready to be delivered. It's like a notification that says, "Pizza's ready!" The delivery driver can see this event on their app and knows it's time to pick up the pizza and head to the customer's address.

In this pizza delivery scenario, messages are used to share order details, queues help manage the orders in a systematic way, and events notify the driver when the pizza is ready for delivery. All these pieces work together to make sure the pizza reaches the customer's doorstep without any confusion or delays.

## Examples - They are widely used in microservices app
**QUEUE**
-  in a large e-commerce platform, you might use queues to manage order processing, ensuring that tasks like payment verification and inventory update happen smoothly without blocking the main user interface.
-  where data needs to be processed in large batches, message queues can be used to organize and distribute tasks across multiple processing units. This is common in data warehousing, reporting, and analytics applications
**MESSAGES**
- IOT:  Using messages and events, the devices can communicate important updates like sensor readings, device status changes, or alarms.

- No, messages, queues, and events are not exclusive to microservices-based applications. While they are commonly used in microservices architectures, they have broader applications across various types of software systems. Here are some additional use cases outside of microservices:

1. **Monolithic Applications:**
   Even in traditional monolithic applications (where all components are tightly integrated), messages, queues, and events can be valuable. For example, in a large e-commerce platform, you might use queues to manage order processing, ensuring that tasks like payment verification and inventory update happen smoothly without blocking the main user interface.

2. **Batch Processing:**
   In scenarios where data needs to be processed in large batches, message queues can be used to organize and distribute tasks across multiple processing units. This is common in data warehousing, reporting, and analytics applications.

3. **Background Jobs:**
   Any application that requires background tasks, like sending emails, generating reports, or performing data cleanup, can benefit from message queues. The tasks can be put into a queue, allowing the application to continue working while the tasks are processed asynchronously.

4. **Internet of Things (IoT):**
   In IoT systems, devices often send data to central servers for processing. Using messages and events, the devices can communicate important updates like sensor readings, device status changes, or alarms.

5. **Real-Time Collaborative Applications:**
   Applications that involve multiple users collaborating on a shared resource, like document editing or multiplayer games, can utilize events to notify users of changes made by others in real time.

6. **Notification Systems:**
   Any application that needs to send notifications to users, such as social media platforms or messaging apps, can use messages to trigger notifications and events to inform users about new messages, likes, comments, etc.

7. **Workflow Orchestration:**
   In complex business processes, message queues can be used to manage and coordinate the flow of tasks across different stages of the workflow.

8. **Microcontroller Communication:**
   Even in low-level systems programming, messages and events are useful. For instance, in embedded systems or microcontroller-based applications, messages can be used to communicate between different hardware components.

9. **Serverless Architectures:**
   In serverless computing, where functions are executed in response to events, messages and events are essential. Services like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions use events to trigger function execution based on certain conditions.

In all of these use cases, the underlying concept of messages, queues, and events remains the same: enabling communication, coordination, and asynchronous processing. While these concepts can greatly benefit microservices-based applications, their utility extends far beyond that specific architecture.

[storage queue vs service bus queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-azure-and-service-bus-queues-compared-contrasted#foundational-capabilities)

> Azure Event Hub is for gathering and organizing lots of data quickly, like stories at a party.
Azure Service Bus is for reliably sending messages between different parts of a software system, like a super mailman for your digital applications.
## event hub
use Event Hubs to ingest millions of events per second from connected devices and applications.
- Data is valuable only when there's an easy way to process and get timely insights from data sources. Event Hubs provides a distributed stream processing platform with low latency and seamless integration, with data and analytics services inside and outside Azure to build your complete big data pipeline.

Event Hubs represents the "front door" for an event pipeline, often called an event ingestor in solution architectures

## event grid
Azure Event Grid to react to relevant events across both Azure and non-Azure services in near-real time fashion.
- fully managed Pub Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns using the MQTT and HTTP protocols.

Azure service	Purpose	Message or Event	Usage scenario
Azure Event Grid	Reactive programming	Event distribution (discrete)	React to status changes ðŸ’¡
Azure Event Hubs	Big data pipeline	Event streaming (series)	Conduct telemetry and distributed data streaming ðŸ’¡
Azure Service Bus	High-value enterprise messaging	Message	Fulfill order processing and financial transactions

- Reactive programming is an approach to building systems that respond to events and changes as they happen. VS Imperative : YOu specify the Sequence of events
- **EVENT GRID VS EVENT HUB**
- Azure Event Grid, on the other hand, is more focused on event routing and triggering reactive actions across different services. It's designed for scenarios where you want to react to events in near real-time, but it doesn't have the same high-throughput capabilities as Event Hub. It's often used for building event-driven architectures that involve triggering actions or updates in response to specific events.
- Azure Event Hub is a data streaming platform that is designed specifically for ingesting and processing large volumes of real-time event data.
