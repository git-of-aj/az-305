## event vs msg
- [MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-application-architecture/)
- https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/compare-messaging-services#event
- Certainly, let's break down messages, queues, and events in simple terms, along with a real-life example:

**Messages:**
Messages are like little packets of information that one part of a computer system can send to another part. These messages can contain all sorts of important details or instructions. Imagine sending a note to a friend with a question â€“ that note is like a message in a computer system.

**Queue:**
A queue is like a waiting line for messages. When a computer system has a lot of messages to send or tasks to do, it lines them up in a queue. Just like people waiting in line for their turn at a ticket counter, messages wait in a queue until they're ready to be processed.

**Events:**
Events are like signals that tell different parts of a computer system that something has happened. They're like notifications that say, "Hey, this just occurred!" These notifications help parts of the system know when to do something specific.

**Real-Life Example: Online Food Delivery Service**

Let's say you're running an online food delivery service, like a modern-day pizza delivery app. Here's how messages, queues, and events might come into play:

1. **Messages:**
   You want to tell the kitchen what pizza someone has ordered and where it needs to be delivered. You send a message containing the order details like the type of pizza, delivery address, and contact number. This message ensures the kitchen knows exactly what to prepare.

2. **Queue:**
   Now imagine many people are ordering pizzas all at once. Instead of overwhelming the kitchen with all the orders at once, the orders are placed in a queue. It's like a line of orders. The kitchen takes one order at a time from the front of the line and prepares that pizza. Then, it moves on to the next order in the queue.

3. **Events:**
   When the pizza is ready, an event is generated. This event tells the delivery driver that the pizza is hot and ready to be delivered. It's like a notification that says, "Pizza's ready!" The delivery driver can see this event on their app and knows it's time to pick up the pizza and head to the customer's address.

In this pizza delivery scenario, messages are used to share order details, queues help manage the orders in a systematic way, and events notify the driver when the pizza is ready for delivery. All these pieces work together to make sure the pizza reaches the customer's doorstep without any confusion or delays.

## Examples - They are widely used in microservices app
**QUEUE**
-  in a large e-commerce platform, you might use queues to manage order processing, ensuring that tasks like payment verification and inventory update happen smoothly without blocking the main user interface.
-  where data needs to be processed in large batches, message queues can be used to organize and distribute tasks across multiple processing units. This is common in data warehousing, reporting, and analytics applications
**MESSAGES**
- IOT:  Using messages and events, the devices can communicate important updates like sensor readings, device status changes, or alarms.

- No, messages, queues, and events are not exclusive to microservices-based applications. While they are commonly used in microservices architectures, they have broader applications across various types of software systems. Here are some additional use cases outside of microservices:

1. **Monolithic Applications:**
   Even in traditional monolithic applications (where all components are tightly integrated), messages, queues, and events can be valuable. For example, in a large e-commerce platform, you might use queues to manage order processing, ensuring that tasks like payment verification and inventory update happen smoothly without blocking the main user interface.

2. **Batch Processing:**
   In scenarios where data needs to be processed in large batches, message queues can be used to organize and distribute tasks across multiple processing units. This is common in data warehousing, reporting, and analytics applications.

3. **Background Jobs:**
   Any application that requires background tasks, like sending emails, generating reports, or performing data cleanup, can benefit from message queues. The tasks can be put into a queue, allowing the application to continue working while the tasks are processed asynchronously.

4. **Internet of Things (IoT):**
   In IoT systems, devices often send data to central servers for processing. Using messages and events, the devices can communicate important updates like sensor readings, device status changes, or alarms.

5. **Real-Time Collaborative Applications:**
   Applications that involve multiple users collaborating on a shared resource, like document editing or multiplayer games, can utilize events to notify users of changes made by others in real time.

6. **Notification Systems:**
   Any application that needs to send notifications to users, such as social media platforms or messaging apps, can use messages to trigger notifications and events to inform users about new messages, likes, comments, etc.

7. **Workflow Orchestration:**
   In complex business processes, message queues can be used to manage and coordinate the flow of tasks across different stages of the workflow.

8. **Microcontroller Communication:**
   Even in low-level systems programming, messages and events are useful. For instance, in embedded systems or microcontroller-based applications, messages can be used to communicate between different hardware components.

9. **Serverless Architectures:**
   In serverless computing, where functions are executed in response to events, messages and events are essential. Services like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions use events to trigger function execution based on certain conditions.

In all of these use cases, the underlying concept of messages, queues, and events remains the same: enabling communication, coordination, and asynchronous processing. While these concepts can greatly benefit microservices-based applications, their utility extends far beyond that specific architecture.

> Azure Event Hub is for gathering and organizing lots of data quickly, like stories at a party.
Azure Service Bus is for reliably sending messages between different parts of a software system, like a super mailman for your digital applications.
## event hub
use Event Hubs to ingest millions of events per second from connected devices and applications.
- Data is valuable only when there's an easy way to process and get timely insights from data sources. Event Hubs provides a distributed stream processing platform with low latency and seamless integration, with data and analytics services inside and outside Azure to build your complete big data pipeline.

Event Hubs represents the "front door" for an event pipeline, often called an event ingestor in solution architectures

## event grid

Azure service	Purpose	Message or Event	Usage scenario
Azure Event Grid	Reactive programming	Event distribution (discrete)	React to status changes ðŸ’¡
Azure Event Hubs	Big data pipeline	Event streaming (series)	Conduct telemetry and distributed data streaming ðŸ’¡
Azure Service Bus	High-value enterprise messaging	Message	Fulfill order processing and financial transactions

- Reactive programming is an approach to building systems that respond to events and changes as they happen. VS Imperative : YOu specify the Sequence of events
- **EVENT GRID VS EVENT HUB**
- Azure Event Grid, on the other hand, is more focused on event routing and triggering reactive actions across different services. It's designed for scenarios where you want to react to events in near real-time, but it doesn't have the same high-throughput capabilities as Event Hub. It's often used for building event-driven architectures that involve triggering actions or updates in response to specific events.
- Azure Event Hub is a data streaming platform that is designed specifically for ingesting and processing large volumes of real-time event data.

  ## Azure Cache for Redis
  Let's consider a real-time collaborative task management application as our example app. This app allows users to create tasks, share them with collaborators, and track progress in real time. Redis can be used in various key scenarios to enhance the app's performance and functionality:

1. **Data Cache:**
In the task management app, frequently accessed task lists and details can be cached in Redis. Whenever a user requests their task list, the app first checks Redis. If the data is found, it's served from Redis, reducing the load on the primary database. This speeds up the user experience, especially for users who repeatedly access their tasks.

2. **Content Cache:**
If the app generates reports or statistics based on task data, these results can be cached in Redis. For example, daily progress summaries or frequently accessed task metrics can be stored in Redis. This ensures that the app doesn't need to regenerate these reports every time they're requested, leading to faster response times.

3. **Session Store:**
Redis can be used to store user sessions, ensuring that users remain authenticated and their data stays consistent across different instances of the app. When a user logs in, their session data (such as authentication tokens) can be stored in Redis. This way, even if the user switches devices or browsers, they don't need to log in again, providing a seamless experience.

4. **Job and Message Queuing:**
Suppose the app needs to send notifications to users about upcoming tasks or changes made by collaborators. Redis can function as a message queue. When a task is updated or a new task is created, the app can enqueue messages in Redis. Separate worker processes can then dequeue and process these messages, sending notifications to the relevant users.

5. **Distributed Transactions:**
In the task management app, let's say a task can only be marked as complete if it's assigned to a user. This involves updating both the task status and the user's profile. Using a Redis transaction, you can ensure that both updates occur atomically. If either operation fails, Redis rolls back the entire transaction, ensuring data consistency.

While Redis can greatly enhance the performance and capabilities of the task management app, it's important to remember that Redis primarily operates in memory. Therefore, for critical data, you might want to use Redis in conjunction with a durable data store, like a relational database, to ensure data persistence.

In summary, Redis can significantly improve the speed, responsiveness, and functionality of a real-time collaborative task management application by serving as a data cache, content cache, session store, message queue, and even enabling simple distributed transactions.

## Azure API Management:
It acts as a gateway between your backend services and the external world, offering a centralized platform to manage the entire API lifecycle.

Azure API Management and Azure App Service are both valuable services, but they serve different purposes in the context of creating APIs for production environments. Let's explore how Azure API Management is preferred over Azure App Service for API management in a production environment:

**Azure API Management:**

Azure API Management is a comprehensive solution that provides tools to create, publish, secure, analyze, and manage APIs. It acts as a gateway between your backend services and the external world, offering a centralized platform to manage the entire API lifecycle.

Here's why Azure API Management is preferred for API management in a production environment:

1. **API Gateway Functionality:** API Management acts as a gateway, handling API traffic routing, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. This offloads these concerns from your backend services, ensuring better security and scalability.

2. **Security and Authentication:** API Management allows you to enforce security measures like API keys, OAuth, and JWT validation. This is crucial to control who accesses your APIs and what actions they can perform.

3. **Developer and Consumer Portal:** API Management provides a developer portal where you can document your APIs, offer interactive documentation, and even allow developers to register and generate API keys. This fosters a better developer experience and encourages API adoption.

4. **Analytics and Monitoring:** API Management offers detailed analytics and monitoring capabilities. You can track API usage, performance, error rates, and more, helping you optimize your APIs and respond to issues quickly.

5. **Caching and Transformation:** API Management enables response caching and request/response transformation, optimizing the API's performance and reducing the load on your backend services.

**Azure App Service:**

Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service offering for hosting web applications, APIs, and mobile backends. While it's suitable for deploying APIs, it doesn't provide the same level of API management and features as Azure API Management.

Here's why you might not prefer Azure App Service for API management in a production environment:

1. **Limited API Management Features:** While you can deploy APIs using Azure App Service, it lacks many advanced features required for proper API management, such as detailed analytics, developer portal, authentication mechanisms, and rate limiting.

2. **Scalability and Load Balancing:** Azure API Management is built to handle API traffic at scale and provides advanced load balancing features specifically designed for APIs. App Service, while capable of scaling, might not be optimized for API traffic management.

3. **Developer Experience:** Azure API Management offers a dedicated developer portal that enhances the experience for API consumers. This portal is not available out-of-the-box with Azure App Service.

In summary, when creating APIs for a production environment, Azure API Management is preferred over Azure App Service due to its dedicated API management features, security capabilities, developer portal, analytics, and performance optimizations specifically tailored for APIs. While Azure App Service is a great choice for hosting web applications, it doesn't provide the same level of API management functionality as Azure API Management.

## IAC Best Practice:
Where possible, uses declarative definition filesÂ - this is simple and effective

```yaml
// this is declrative synntax - do not give step by step : Just give Intention
- name: my-vm
  image: ubuntu
  size: Standard_D2s_v3
  network:
    subnet: my-subnet
```
