Front-end tier:
For the front-end tier, I would recommend using Azure App Service. Azure App Service is a fully managed platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that allows you to host and scale web applications effortlessly. It supports .NET Core applications, making it a suitable choice for the existing .NET Core-based web app.

Reasons for choosing Azure App Service:
1. **Scalability**: Azure App Service can automatically scale the number of instances based on demand. This will handle the peak periods when 1750 customers visit the website each hour, and scale down during off hours to save costs.

2. **Managed Service**: Azure App Service abstracts the infrastructure management, making it easier for the IT team to focus on the application's functionality rather than server management.

3. **High Availability**: Azure App Service provides built-in high availability, ensuring that the application remains accessible even during hardware or software failures.

Middle tier:
For the middle tier, I would recommend using Azure Functions. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run small pieces of code (functions) in response to events. It is well-suited for processing customer support requests and queuing them for help desk support.

Reasons for choosing Azure Functions:
1. **Serverless Architecture**: Azure Functions automatically scales based on demand, so it can handle varying numbers of support requests (75-125 per hour) without the need for manual provisioning or over-provisioning.

2. **Event-driven**: Azure Functions can be triggered by various events, such as incoming requests or messages in a queue. This makes it ideal for handling support requests as they come in.

3. **Cost Efficiency**: Since Azure Functions are billed based on execution time, it is cost-effective during off hours when support requests are low. The IT team won't have to pay for idle resources.

Well Architected Framework pillars:
To produce a high-quality, stable, and efficient cloud architecture, the Well-Architected Framework's key pillars should be incorporated:

1. **Operational Excellence**: By using Azure App Service and Azure Functions, Tailwind Traders can take advantage of the managed services, which handle operational tasks like infrastructure management and scaling. This helps in achieving operational excellence with minimal administrative efforts.

2. **Security**: The use of Azure App Service and Azure Functions follows Microsoft's best security practices and provides built-in security features. The IT team can further enhance security by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access.

3. **Reliability**: Both Azure App Service and Azure Functions offer high availability and automatic scaling, ensuring that the application remains reliable and responsive even during peak periods or failures.

4. **Performance Efficiency**: Azure App Service and Azure Functions allow Tailwind Traders to optimize resource usage and costs by automatically scaling up or down based on demand.

5. **Cost Optimization**: With Azure Functions being serverless, Tailwind Traders can save costs during off hours when support requests are low, as they only pay for the actual execution time.

By considering these pillars, Tailwind Traders can design a cloud architecture that is well-architected, reliable, secure, and cost-effective. This approach ensures that the migration of their product catalog application to the cloud will be successful and provide a positive experience to their customers.
